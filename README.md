MIP Automation Project

Overview

This project automates the analysis of MIP data, making it easy to generate district-wise and block-wise reports. It ensures that only middle schools are included in the analysis, improving efficiency and flexibility compared to manual Excel processes. The project also includes a basic dashboard setup for quick visualization of results.

Features

Automated Data Analysis: Reduces manual effort by automating MIP data analysis.

Customizable: Easily update the list of schools or add new features.

District and Block Reports: Generates detailed district-wise and block-wise reports.

Basic Dashboard: Provides a simple visualization of MIP status.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

Google Colab (optional for running the notebook)

Steps

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mip-automation-project.git
cd mip-automation-project

Install Required Libraries:
Install dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare Your Data:

Place your MIP data files in the data/ directory (if applicable).

Update the list of middle schools in the required format.

Run the Notebook or Script:

Use the provided Jupyter Notebook (mip_analysis.ipynb) for an interactive experience.

Alternatively, run the Python script:

python scripts/mip_analysis.py

Google Colab Setup

If you want to use Google Colab:

Upload the mip_analysis.ipynb file to Colab.

Ensure the required data files are uploaded to your Colab environment.

Run the notebook cell by cell.

Output

The script generates:

District-wise Table: Includes total schools, number of schools for each MIP status, and their percentages.

Block-wise Table: Similar to the district table but with an additional block-level breakdown.

Dashboard: Visualizes key insights from the data.
